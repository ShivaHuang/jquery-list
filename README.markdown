Floating List Header Plugin
===========================

This is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin which allows the user to create a list with 
floating headings while scrolling, a-la iOS & iCal day view. The plugin allows arbitrary 
markup of the header and list items, and will work nicely with nested elements.
